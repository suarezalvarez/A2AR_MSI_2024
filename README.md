## Background

G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are proteins with seven transmembrane domains. Their activation is generally characterized by a reorganization of the cytoplasmic side that exposes an intracellular pocket. This pocket is involved in interaction with other proteins such as G proteins, GPCR kinases (GRKs) and arrestins [1].

Adenosine is the natural ligand of adenosine receptors (ARs), with high affinity to the A2A receptor type. This receptor is a GPCR characterized by stimulating the production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) via the adenylyl cyclase. A2A proteins are mostly expressed in dopamine-rich regions of the brain, although they are also found in tissues such as endothelial and lymphoid cells, blood vessels and several types of neurons in the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system [2].

In this paper we describe the dynamics of the adenosine A2A receptor bound to an adenosine molecule (PDB structure 2YDO [3]), and 2 adenosine derivatives that were designed to improve ligand affinity. This was done by means of classical molecular dynamics (MD) and steered molecular dynamics (SMD).

## Motivation 

This is a project from the course on Molecular Simulations (MSc in bioinformatics for Health Sciences, UPF) carried out by Javier Herranz del Cerro, Estel Martín Alarcón and Martín Suárez Álvarez. The analysis was carried out using GROMACS (classical MD simulations), NAMD (SMD simulations), VMD (structure visualization and analysis of RMSD and water volmaps) and R (plots and graphics). 

The final aim was to write a paper using these simulations. You can find the paper in this repository.
